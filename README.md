# GLaDOS

GLaDOS is the _**G**iant **L**ibrary **a**nd **D**istributed **O**rganizing **S**ystem_.  Its
purpose is to organize the vast amount of code I have created over the years.

* **Accessibility**: Access and modify code from any computer
* **Code Reuse**: Search all code
* **Preservation**: Keep code backed up
* **Publishing**: Share code with others (in a sane way), but don't require publishing.
